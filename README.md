This repository is a Houdini Pipeline Toolkit, currently at the early stages of developing. 
The goal is to create **out of the box VFX pipeline** for **Houdini** and **Nuke** applications under control of **Shotgun** management system
for a single artist or animation studio. It is full CG oriented pipeline which can handle small tasks with just a few shots as well as huge projects like animation feature or TV series.

The pipeline would be heavily rely on [Animation DNA](https://github.com/kiryha/AnimationDNA/wiki) structure and ideas.
